### Hello!

![Follow me on Twitter!](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/LittleKitacho?label=Follow%20me%21&style=social)

Hi, I am LittleKitacho.  I own and run my own Discord bot, [Ally], and have lots of side projects.

#### About me

I am a hobbyist, self-taught programmer who loves to think of an idea and it come to reality.  My main languages are
Python and Javascript, but I know some C#/Unity and have a grasp of C/C++.

#### What I'm working on

Currently, I am working on a private project, involving Jeopardy, but I don't want to give too many details since
the repo is private still.

Plus, I'm working on [Ally] in the background still, and could use [some help](https://github.com/allydiscord/ally/issues)!
